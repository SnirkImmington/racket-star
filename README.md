racket-sharp
==================

A .NET based LISP style interpreter, designed to work with most racket code, adapting the C# cdoebase.

Currently planned to work with all C# code using basic data types, unsure of what kind of object system to use.

This should be comparable with basic racket code, some method renaming may be required.
