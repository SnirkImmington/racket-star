Missing from compilations:
==========================
1. Nested class declarations won't have generic parameters, i.e. "ParentFoo<string>.ChildFoo<int>.SomeMethod<bool>()" is not possible.
2. Array syntax not implemented.
3. Probably not going to implement the "new" keyword for function/field creation
4. Probably not going to implement extension methods.


Dialect Differences in the Code
===============================
1. NO TYPE GENERICS IN RACKET
2. Full reflection type creation in C#
